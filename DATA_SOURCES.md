## MIMIC Data
All MIMIC data was received from Jeremy Miller, or the Wells Estuarine Research 
Reserve, who manages the MIMIC program in Maine.

Because MIMIC is a volunteer based effort, records are sometimes incomplete.
With "PERFECT" attendance (or monitoring) each site would produce 6 monitoring
events or site visits per year. Data completeness varies site to site and year.
Analyses should consider differences in sampling effort.

Abundance is handled by grouping into "Abundant, Common, Few, and Rare".
"Not present" is also real data, but the way data collection is organized 
MIMIC only records presence, not absence, and absence must be inferred by the 
lack of data on a positive siting.

## Rapid Assessment Survey Data
Data from the Regional "Rapid Assessment Surveys" is available in
periodic reports on rapid assessment surveys available from the Massachusetts
Office of Coastal Zone Management.

A Word document reporting on the 2007 RAS survey was found, also included
here, was archived in CBEP's 2015 State of the Bay Data Archive.

RAS surveys are far more complete than the volunteer-based MIMIC data, but even
here, care should be taken regarding data interpretation from survey to survey.
In particular, species identifications, especially for less common or more 
obscure invertebrates, may be affected by membership of the group of taxonomic
experts who participated in each survey.
