# Introduction
This Notebook provides graphic summaries of data from the MIMIC invasive species 
monitoring program from Casco Bay

The Marine Invader Monitoring and Information Collaborative (MIMIC) in Casco Bay 
is a partnership between CBEP, the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve 
(Wells NERR), and the regional MIMIC program.  The Regional effort includes 
participants from several other New England States.

Wells NERR trains community scientists to identify (currently) 23 species of 
invasives, including tunicates, bryozoans, algae and crustaceans. Scientists 
visit sites monthly between May and October and document abundance of these 
non-native species. 

The program began with two sites in Casco Bay in 2008 and has expanded in 
ensuing years to sample an additional mainland site and 12 sites across four 
Islands (Peaks, Chebeague, Long, and Great Diamond).

# Load Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
# dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

We have data presented on two tabs, "Master Data Record" and 
'Removed-discontinued sites'.  it's not obvious why we would omit data from a
discontinued site.  It depends on the underlying purpose.
```{r}
fn <- 'MIMIC_MASTER_DATA_Wells_022521.xls'
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

the_data <- read_excel(fpath, sheet = 'Master Data Record',
                       na = c('', 'na', 'NA')) %>%
  mutate(Month = as.numeric(format(Date, format = '%m')),
         Month = factor(Month, levels = 1:12, labels =  month.abb),
         Year = as.numeric(format(Date, format = '%Y'))) %>%
  filter(! is.na(Date)) %>%
  rename(Salinity = `Salinty (ppt)`,      # Note spelling error
         Temp     = `H20 temp C`)   %>%   # Note that's  H 2 zero,
  select(-State)
```


# Data on "Discontinued Sites"
These sites are present in the data, each with only one year of data, and they
were not included in State of Casco Bay for 2020.
```{r } 
other_data  <- read_excel(fpath, sheet = 'Removed-discontinued sites',
                       na = c('', 'na', 'NA')) %>%
  mutate(Month = as.numeric(format(Date, format = '%m')),
         Month = factor(Month, levels = 1:12, labels =  month.abb),
         Year = as.numeric(format(Date, format = '%Y'))) %>%  filter(! is.na(Date)) %>%
  rename(Salinity = `Salinty (ppt)`,   # Note spelling error
         Temp     = `H20 temp C`)      # Note that's  H 2 zero,

all_data <- bind_rows(the_data, other_data)


```

## Correct Town
We correct the misattribution of Cousins Island to Portland (it's in Yarmouth).
```{r}
other_data <- other_data %>%
  mutate(City  = if_else(Site ==  "Cousin Island Dock", "Yarmouth", City)) 
#rm(other_data)
```

# Data Review
## Inconsistent Data Entry
### Species Nomenclature
```{r}
sort(unique(the_data$Species))
```

So we have a couple of things to note:  
1.  Inconsistent coding of Membranipora  
2.  Inconsistent capitalization of Palaemon 
3.  "Colpomenia pereqrina" is misspelled , with a "Q" where it should have a "G"

### Abundance Levels
Show inconsistent capitalization.
```{r}
sort(unique(the_data$Abundance))
```
Again, we have inconsistent capitalization

### Site Types
Also suffer from inconsistent capitalization....  Note that we have 
"Cobble Shore" as a category here, but it was not used in Casco Bay, so will
drop out of the data once we select only Casco Bay locations.
```{r}
sort(unique(the_data$Type))
```

## Correct Inconsistent Coding
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(Species = if_else(grepl('Membranipora', Species, ignore.case = TRUE), 
                           'Membranipora sp.', 
                           Species)) %>%
  mutate(Species = if_else(grepl('Palaemon ', Species, ignore.case = TRUE), 
                           'Palaemon elegans', 
                           Species)) %>%
  mutate(Species = if_else(grepl('Colpomenia ', Species, ignore.case = TRUE), 
                           'Colpomenia peregrina', 
                           Species))
```

```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(Abundance = paste0(toupper(substr(Abundance, 1, 1)), 
                            tolower(substr(Abundance, 2, nchar(Abundance)))),
         Abundance = (na_if(Abundance, 'NANA')),
         Abundance = ordered(Abundance, levels = c('Rare', 'Few', 'Common', 'Abundant') )) %>%
  
 mutate(Type = paste0(toupper(substr(Type, 1, 1)), 
                            tolower(substr(Type, 2, nchar(Type)))),
        Type = (na_if(Type, 'NANA')),
        Type = (na_if(Type, 'Cobble shore')),  # Only used outside of Casco Bay
        Type = factor(Type) )
```

### Review  Levels Again
```{r}
sort(unique(the_data$Species))
sort(unique(the_data$Abundance))
sort(unique(the_data$Type))
```

## Cities and Sites
We have data from outside of Casco Bay, which we need to eliminate.  While we 
are at it, we can correct some minor errors (spelling and towns).
```{r}
unique(the_data$City)
```


## Select Only Casco Bay Data
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  filter(City %in% c('Chebeague', 'Long Island', 'Portland', 'South Portland'))
```


## Casco Bay Site List
```{r}
xtabs(~ Site + Type, data = the_data)
```

## Convert Sites to a Factor
Matt Liebman of EPA requested graphics ordered by distance of each island from
the Mainland (as he described it), and grouped or otherwise coded by Mainland
vs. Island and dock vs. tidepool. We create factors to address that need
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels = 
                         c(  "Siegel's Reef",
                             "Spring Point Marina",
                             "SMCC Dock", 
                             
                             "Peaks Dock",
                             "Peaks Tidepool",
                             
                             "Great Diamond Island Dock", 
                             "Great Diamond Island Tidepool",
                             
                             "Long Island Dock",
                             "Fowler's Tide Pool",
                             
                             "Chandlers Wharf Dock",
                             #"Chebeague Island Boat Yard",  # Discontinued Site. Dropped...
                             "Chebeague Stone Pier", 
                             "Waldo Point"                 #,
                             
                             #"Cousin Island Dock"         # Discontinued Site. Dropped...
                         )))
```

### Add Additional Indicator
```{r}
translator <- tribble(
  ~Site, ~Where,
  
  "Siegel's Reef",                  "Mainland",
  "Spring Point Marina",            "Mainland",
  "SMCC Dock",                      "Mainland",
  
  "Peaks Dock",                     "Peaks",
  "Peaks Tidepool",                 "Peaks",
 
  "Great Diamond Island Dock",      "Great Diamond",
  "Great Diamond Island Tidepool",  "Great Diamond",
  
  "Long Island Dock",               "Long",
  "Fowler's Tide Pool",             "Long",
  
  "Chandlers Wharf Dock",           "Chebeague",
  "Chebeague Island Boat Yard",     "Chebeague", # Discontinued Site. Dropped...
  "Chebeague Stone Pier",           "Chebeague",
  "Waldo Point",                    "Chebeague",
 
  "Cousin Island Dock",             "Cousins",   # Discontinued Site. Dropped... 
)


the_data <- the_data %>%
  left_join(translator , by = 'Site')
```


## Handling "Missing" Abundance Data
There is no reason why data should have been collected without related abundance
information, if all protocols were being followed.  Here we look more closely at
those observations to figure out how best to handle them.

In e-mail exchanges with Jeremy Miller, of Wells Estuarine Research Reserve, 
he anticipates that most are errors introduced by volunteers not recording data.
Given the way the data sheets are constructed, and volunteers are trained, most
probably represent observations where observers failed to record abundance.
Accordingly, an observation is evidence for presence of the species, but we do 
not know at what level.  We would have to make some sort of assumption about
when observers would be most likely to omit abundance information to use these
observations in proportional odds models.

Many observations have comments in the data that provide context or confirm that
no abundance data was provided, etc.

### Distribution of Missing Abundance Data
```{r}
the_data %>% 
  filter(is.na(Abundance)) %>%
  group_by(Site, Year) %>%
  summarize(missed = any(is.na(Abundance)),
            count_missed  = sum(is.na(Abundance)))
  
```

### Checking Missing Data 
#### 2010 Data
```{r}
the_data %>%
  filter(Year == 2010) %>%
  select(-Date, -Type, -City, -Weather, -`Salinity`, 
         -Temp)
```

It appears that no data in 2010 was collected with abundance data.  (At that 
time, only the two "Mainland" stations were being monitored.)

#### Chebeage Stone Pier 2016 Missing Abundance Data
```{r}
the_data %>% 
  filter(Site == "Chebeague Stone Pier", Year == 2016) %>%
  select(-Type, -Year, -Site, -City, -Weather, -Salinity, 
         -Temp, -Comments)
```

So, the missing observations from 2016 are all are from the month of October.
This was one site visit in which full data was not collected.

#### Spring Point Marine 2018 Missing Abundance Data
```{r}
the_data %>% 
  filter(Site == "Spring Point Marina", Year == 2018) %>%
  select(-Type, -Year, -Site, -City, -Weather, -Salinity, 
         -Temp, -Comments)
```

The data without Abundances from 2018 is all from the month of July. Again, it 
is likely this represents a data sheet that was not fully filled in.

What that shows is that MOST sites in MOST years, lack of abundance happened
rarely.  The exceptions are:

Site                   |     Year   |    Month
-----------------------|------------|-------------
Spring Point Marina    |     2018   | July
Chebeague Stone Pier   |     2016   | October
Siegel's Reef          |     2010   | All
SMCC Dock              |     2010   | All
-----------------------|------------|-------------

For each of those, we effectively have monthly visits that lacks all abundance
data.

#### Remaining Missing Abundance Data
Lets look at what is left after we remove those data sheets where data was 
improperly recorded.
```{r}
the_data %>%
  filter(! (Site == "Chebeague Stone Pier"  & Year ==  2016  & Month == 'October'),
         ! (Site == "Siegel's Reef" & Year ==  2010 ),
         ! (Site == "SMCC Dock"  & Year ==   2010),
         ! (Site == "Spring Point Marina" & Year == 2018)) %>%
  filter(is.na(Abundance)) %>%
  filter(Comments != "No abundance recorded") %>%
  filter(! is.na(Species)) %>%
  select(-Date, -Type, -City, -Weather, -Salinity, 
         -Temp, -Abundance) %>%
  arrange
```
Based on the Comments, we believe we should retain each of these as indicating
an actual (if unquantified) observation of each species, EXCEPT, 

2012	Jul	Siegel’s Reef	Membranipora sp. 

For that record,we accept the check mark, marked as "Absent", as described in the 
Accordingly, we delete that observation now.
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  filter(! (Year == 2012 &
           Month == 'Jul' & 
           Site == "Siegel's Reef" &
           Species == "Membranipora sp."))
```


## No Species Reported
Some rows contain date and time information, but no species designation.
```{r}
the_data %>%
  filter(is.na(Species)) %>%
  select(-Date, -Type, -City, -Weather, -Salinity, 
         -Temp, -Abundance)
```
These records are all markers of an actual site visit that resulted in no
observed species.  Removing empty these rows would understate effort, so could
overestimate prevalence.  We do not want to delete these records.

## Duplicate Records
We use `pivot-wider()` (with `values_fn = length`) followed by `pivot_longer()` 
and then filter to identify records collected on the same date and site.
```{r}
the_data %>%
  select(-Type, -City, -Weather, -Comments, -Salinity, -Temp) %>%
  mutate(Abundance = as.character(Abundance)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Species, 
              values_from = Abundance,
              values_fn = length,
              #values_fill = "Absent"
              ) %>% 
  pivot_longer( 6:24, names_to = "Species", values_to = "Count") %>%
  filter(Count > 1)
```

### First Duplicate Field Record
```{r}
the_data %>%
  filter(Year    == 2013 &
     Month   == 'Jul' &
     Site    == "Siegel's Reef") %>%
  arrange(Species)
```
These show mostly PAIRS of duplicate observations, with differences in wording of 
Weather and different temperatures.  That suggests two different observers. 
Different temperatures suggest different times of day, or different
thermometers, not well calibrated.

One observer (?) noted Green Crab, the other did not.   perhaps
a trainer and a trainee.  The abundance data differs in several places
by one abundance class.

We judge it is better to select the sample that  observed the green crab, as 
most of our analyses will be based on presence/absence.


#### Check Selection
```{r}
the_data %>%
  filter(Year    == 2013 &
           Month   == 'Jul' &
           Site    == "Siegel's Reef" &
           Weather == 'Partly cloudy') %>%
  arrange(Species)
```

#### Remove Duplicate Records
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  filter( ! (Year    == 2013 &
               Month   == 'Jul' &
               Site    == "Siegel's Reef" &
               Weather == 'Partly cloudy'))
```


### Second Duplicate Field Record
```{r}
the_data %>%
  filter(Year == 2015 &
     Month    == 'Aug' &
     Site     == 'Chebeague Stone Pier') %>%
  arrange(Species, Date)
```

Note a few things:
1.  We have two sample collections in the same month.  We do not want to delete 
    the wrong observations.
2.  We have two pairs of observations on 2015-08-05 that are exact duplicates,
    except for Weather or Comments. 

Different Weather descriptions suggests  these were pulled from two separate
data sheets, filled out by different observers.

#### Check Selection
```{r}
my_date <- as.Date('2015-08-05')

the_data %>%
  filter((Date    == my_date &
          Site == 'Chebeague Stone Pier' &
           Weather == 'Sunny, clear'))
```

#### Remove Duplicate Records
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  filter(! (Date    == my_date &
              Site == 'Chebeague Stone Pier' &
              Weather == 'Sunny, clear'))
```

### Third Duplicate Field Record
```{r}
the_data %>%
  filter(Year    == 2016 &
     Month   == 'Jun' &
     Site    == 'Peaks Tidepool') %>%
  arrange(Species, Date)
```
These show three PAIRS of duplicate observations, with differences in wording of 
Weather and Comments.  That suggest two different observers, perhaps
a trainer and a trainee.  The abundance data is not QUITE
identical, with "Membranipora sp." either "Rare" or "Few".

#### Check Selection
```{r}
the_data %>%
  filter(Year    == 2016 &
           Month   == 'Jun' &
           Site    == 'Peaks Tidepool' &
           Weather == 'Sunny and beautiful') %>%
  arrange(Species, Date)
```

#### Remove Duplicate Records
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  filter( ! (Year    == 2016 &
               Month   == 'Jun' &
               Site    == 'Peaks Tidepool' &
               Weather == 'Sunny and beautiful'))
```


# Construct Presence / Absence Data 
We now have a data set that contains one and only one row for every time a 
species was observed.  If the `Abundance` vector contain data, we have an
estimate of relative abundance, if not, all we know is that the species was 
"present". 

We will proceed to analyze these data principally via presence / absence, 
rather than as relative abundances.

We create a presence / absence data layer.  Basically, any row that remains in
the data at this point indicated the species was "present", so all we need to do
is create a "Present" vector with value "TRUE" everywhere a species is listed, 
and FALSE anywhere else (only those three dates and times when no invasive
species were observed).
```{r}
the_data <- the_data %>%
  mutate(Present = if_else(is.na(Species), FALSE, TRUE))
```

# Data Reorganization
The data we have now is incomplete, as it does not contain structural zeros for 
species not observed.  We need those structural zeros to allow for modeling.
The easiest way to build complete data is to pivot data to wide form, replace 
NAs, and pivot back to long form.  The wide form data would be useful for
ordination and other multivariate procedures, if we chose to pursue them.

Note that this procedure retains any "real" NAs in the Abundance data, while it 
fills in values not present in the draft long data with "Absent".  This means we 
do not count data where species were recorded as "present", which is probematic.
A decision needs t be made on each specific analysis of the relative abundance
data whether to replace those NAs with "Absent" or not.

## Pivot to "Wide" Data Format
```{r}
presence_data_wide <- the_data %>%
  select(-Abundance) %>%
  pivot_wider(-c(Weather, Comments), 
              names_from = Species, 
              values_from = Present,
              values_fill = FALSE
              )

abundance_data_wide <- the_data %>%
  select(-Present) %>%
  mutate(Abundance = ordered(Abundance, levels = c('Absent', 'Rare', 
                                                  'Few', 'Common', 
                                                  'Abundant'))) %>%
  pivot_wider(-c(Weather, Comments), 
              names_from = Species, 
              values_from = Abundance,
              values_fill = 'Absent'
              )


```


## Pivot Back to "Long" Data Format
```{r}
presence_data <- presence_data_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(`Botrylloides violaceus`:`Tricellaria inopinata`, 
               names_to = 'Species',
               values_to = 'Present')

abundance_data <- abundance_data_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(`Botrylloides violaceus`:`Tricellaria inopinata`, 
               names_to = 'Species',
               values_to = 'Abundance')
```

# Add Common Names
It is convenient to have the common names included in these data, for 
```{r}
names_data <- read_excel(fpath, sheet = 'Species List', skip = 1,
                        col_names = c('Species', 'Common')) %>%
  filter(! is.na(Common))
```

```{r}
presence_data <- presence_data %>%
  left_join(names_data, by = 'Species') %>%
  relocate(Common, .after = Species)

abundance_data <- abundance_data %>%
  left_join(names_data, by = 'Species') %>%
  relocate(Common, .after = Species)

rm(names_data)
```


# Export Revised Data
```{r}
write_csv(abundance_data, 'Abundance_Data.csv')
write_csv(presence_data, 'Presence_Data.csv')
```
