# Introduction
This Notebook looks for long-term trends in abundance of invasive species in
the MIMIC invasive species monitoring program from Casco Bay.

The Marine Invader Monitoring and Information Collaborative (MIMIC) in Casco Bay 
is a partnership between CBEP, the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve 
(Wells NERR), and the regional MIMIC program.  The Regional effort includes 
participants from several other New England States.

Wells NERR trains community scientists to identify (currently) 23 species of 
invasives, including tunicates, bryozoans, algae and crustaceans. Scientists 
visit sites monthly between May and October and document abundance of these 
non-native species. 

The program began with two sites in Casco Bay in 2008 and has expanded in 
ensuing years to sample an additional mainland site and 12 sites across four 
Islands (Peaks, Chebeague, Long, and Great Diamond).  That expansion obviously 
complicates trend analysis, and trends must consider the number of site visits 
each year.

# Add Order Factors
We need to organize graphics by island in consistent structure.
We will use a bar chart, organized by Island and a common sequence within island 
groups.  To facilitate that, we need a factor that orders sites consistently
within island groups.  While we are at it, we create alternate labels for 
the plots.

```{r}
orders <- tribble (
  ~Site,                            ~Order,      ~Label,
  "Spring Point Marina",               1,         "Spring Point Marina",  
  "SMCC Dock",                         2,         "SMCC Dock",
  "Siegel's Reef",                     3,         "Siegel's Reef",  
  
  "Peaks Dock",                        1,          "Peaks Dock",          
  "Peaks Tidepool",                    2,          "Peaks Tidepool", 
  
  "Great Diamond Island Dock",         1,          "Great Diamond Dock",    
  "Great Diamond Island Tidepool",     2,          "Great Diamond Tidepool",
  
  "Long Island Dock",                  1,          "Long Island Dock",  
  "Fowler's Tide Pool",                2,          "Fowler's Tidepool",   
  
  "Chandlers Wharf Dock",              1,          "Chandlers Wharf Dock",  
  "Chebeague Stone Pier",              2,          "Stone Pier",   
  "Waldo Point" ,                      3,          "Waldo Point")
```

```{r}
abundance_data <- abundance_data %>%
  left_join(orders, by = 'Site')

presence_data <- presence_data %>%
  left_join(orders, by = 'Site')
```

#  Analyzing Sampling Effort
Lets look at distribution of EFFORT by sites and years.
```{r}
site_visits <- presence_data %>%
  group_by(Site, Year, Month) %>%
  summarize(Sampled = n() > 0,
            .groups = 'drop')   # This includes NA values, which are still
                                # evidence of a site visit.

site_visits %>%
  group_by(Site, Year) %>%
  summarize(Visits = sum(Sampled)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = Visits) %>%
  select("Site", sort(colnames(.)))
```

So...

1. Only the South Portland sites (Siegel's Reef and SMCC Dock) have a long 
   enough record for robust trend analysis.  Peaks Dock and Chebeague Stone Pier 
   have six years of record.

2. Several Sites have almost never been sampled, and should probably be dropped 
   from any site by site analysis, but could be included in Bay-wide species 
   occurrences.

# Trend Data
For trend sites, we need sites with data from at least five of the last ten
years, and at least two years prior to the most recent five years.

```{r}
trend_sites <- site_visits %>%
  group_by (Site, Year) %>%
  summarize(Sampled = any(Sampled > 0, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  group_by(Site) %>%
  summarize(Years = sum(Sampled),
            Recent = sum(Sampled & Year > 2015),
            .groups = 'keep') %>%
  filter(Years >= 10, Recent >= 3) %>%
  pull(Site)
  
trend_presence_data <- presence_data %>%
  filter (Site %in% trend_sites)
trend_abundance_data <- abundance_data %>%
  filter (Site %in% trend_sites)
```

That tightly restricts our analysis, so may not be optimal.  The problem is
how do we address site-by-site differences in a more complex model where 
some sites have been tracked for only a few years. We probably need to develop 
parallel analyses, using both data from the two sites tracked long enough to
examine trends and all data from all sites. 


# Analysis Pricipals
We have to be a bit careful here about interpreting these data, because of 
varying annual effort. We need to make sure we are scaling analyses by effort.
We will consider a unit of effort to be the combination of a site and a month of 
sampling.

We also need to consider different patterns of "common".  
    *  Species found at high abundances  
    *  Species found in most years  
    *  Species found at most sites.   

Some species appear more abundant in recent years, but that may reflect 
different distributions of effort among years and sites.

This suggests a couple of binomial models. but binomial models are going to 
be structurally unstable, since many species are rare enough that we will have 
structural zeros, and thus a significant Hauke-Donner effect.

# Presence / Absence
## Trend Data
###  Preliminary Graphic
```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8}

visits <- trend_presence_data %>%
  group_by(Year, Site) %>%
  summarize(site_visits = length(unique(Date)),
            .groups = 'drop_last') %>%
  summarize(site_visits = sum(site_visits),
            .groups = 'drop')

tmp <- trend_presence_data %>%
  select(-Common, -City, -Salinity, -Temp) %>%
  group_by(Year, Site, Species) %>%
  summarize(observations = sum(Present, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'keep') %>%
  filter (! is.na(Species)) %>%
  left_join(visits, by = 'Year') %>%
  summarize(site_visits = first (site_visits),
            frequency = observations / site_visits, 
            .groups = 'drop')
tmp
```


```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8}
ggplot(tmp, aes(Year, frequency)) +
  geom_col(aes(Clor = )) +
  facet_wrap(~Species) +

  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2010, 2015, 2020)) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(size = 7))
```

That reveals what look like increases in abundance for six species at these 
two long-term sites:
*Caprella mutica*, *Didemnum vexillum*, *Diplosoma listerianum*, 
*Palaemon elegans*, *Styela clava*, and *Tricellaria inopinata*.  

A few of the other sites may also provide significant changes in abundance, but 
it looks unlikely.

We are aware that the Palaemon was not searched for in the first few years of the
program, but it was not found anywhere in New England until a few years 
ago, so that is unlikely to be a problem. A  few other species were also added
to the program over the period of record, as they because mroe abundant in 
New England.

### Binomial Models
We fit a binomial model for each species independently.

#### Example Binomial Models
```{r}
test_glm <- glm(Present ~ Year, family = binomial(), 
                data = presence_data, subset = Species == 'Styela clava')
summary(test_glm)
```
So that suggests the probability of Observing *Styela* has increased.



```{r}
test_glm <- glm(Present ~ Year, family = binomial(), 
                data = presence_data, subset = Species == 'Caprella mutica')
as_tibble(summary(test_glm)$coefficients)
```
That also suggests the probability of observing *Caprella* has increased.


We can abuse the `emmeans()` function slightly to generate predicted 
probabilities of observing *Caprella* on a ny give nsite visit at one of these
two sites.
```{r}
emms <- emmeans(test_glm, 'Year', at = list(Year = 2008:2020), type = 'response')
plot(emms) +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  xlab('Predicted Probability') +
  ylab('') +
  coord_flip()
```

#### Construct Nested Tibble
```{r}
nested_presence <- presence_data %>%
  filter(! is.na(Species)) %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  nest()
```

#### Add Model and Coefficients Estimate Information
```{r}
nested_presence <- nested_presence %>%
  mutate(year_glm = map(data,
                        function(df) glm(Present ~ Year, family = binomial(), 
                                         data = df))) %>%
  mutate(glm_coef = map(year_glm,
                        function(mod) summary(mod)$coefficients),
        glm_p = glm_coef[[1]][2,4],
         glm_slope = glm_coef[[1]][2,1]) 
```

#### Examine Results
```{r}
for (s in nested_presence$Species) {
  cat('\n\n')
  print(s)
  print(nested_presence$glm_coef[nested_presence$Species == s][[1]])
}
  
```


```{r}
for (s in nested_presence$Species) {
  co <- nested_presence$glm_coef[nested_presence$Species == s][[1]]
  p <- co[2,4] 
  slope <- co[2,1]
  if (p < 0.05) {
    if (slope > 0) 
    {trend = 'Increasing'}
    else
    {trend = 'Decreasing'}
    cat(s)
    cat(', ')
    cat(trend)
    cat('\n')
  }
}
  
```

A few of those are suspect analyses, as data are extremely limited

#### Table of Results
We generate a table of results for potential use in State of Casco Bay.
```{r}
nested_presence %>%
  mutate(older_data = map(data, function(df) df[df$Year < 2015,]),
         newer_data = map(data, function(df) df[df$Year > 2014,]),
         was_here = any(older_data[[1]]$Present),
         is_here = any(newer_data[[1]]$Present)) %>%
  select(-older_data, -newer_data) %>%
  mutate(p     = glm_coef[[1]][2,4],
         slope = glm_coef[[1]][2,1]) %>%
  mutate(Trend = if_else (p>0.05, 
                          'No Trend',
                          if_else(slope > 0,
                                  'Increasing',
                                  'Decreasing'))) %>%
  mutate(Arrivals = if_else(! was_here & is_here, 
                          "New arrival",
                          if_else( ! is_here & was_here,
                                   'No longer seen',
                                   ''))) %>%
  select(Species, Trend, Arrivals) %>%
  arrange(Species) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

# Abundance Data
It's hard to organize the abundance data in a way that 
```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8}
tmp <- trend_abundance_data %>%
  mutate(dummy = 1) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Abundance,
              values_from = dummy, 
              names_repair = "unique") %>%
  rename(Common_Name = Common...11) %>%
  rename(Common  = Common...18) %>%
  relocate(Absent, .before = Rare) %>%
  relocate(Few, Common, Abundant, .after = Rare)
tmp
```

```{r}
tmp <- tmp %>%
  group_by(Year, Species) %>%
  summarize(samples = n(),
           Absent = sum(Absent, na.rm = TRUE) / samples,
           Rare = sum(Rare, na.rm = TRUE) / samples,
           Few = sum(Few, na.rm = TRUE) / samples, 
           Common = sum(Common, na.rm = TRUE) / samples,
           Abundant = sum(Abundant, na.rm = TRUE) / samples,
           .groups = 'drop'
           ) %>%
  filter(! is.na(Species))
tmp
```

```{r}
tmp <- tmp %>%
  pivot_longer(Absent:Abundant, names_to = 'Abundance', values_to = 'Frequency') %>%
  mutate(Abundance = ordered(Abundance,
                             levels = c('Absent', 'Rare', 'Few', 
                                        'Common', 'Abundant')))
tmp
```


```{r fig.width = 9, fig.height = 6}
  ggplot(tmp, aes(Year, fill = Abundance)) +
  geom_col(aes(y = Frequency)) +
  
  scale_fill_manual(values = rev(cbep_colors2()), name = '') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2010, 2015, 2020)) +
  
  facet_wrap(~Species) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(size = 7))


```

# Multinomial Models
Now, how to construct a multinomial model?
We work with `VGAM`, specifically the `vglm()` function  here.

# Example Proportional Odds Model
```{r}
test.vglm <- vglm(Abundance ~ Year, family =cumulative(parallel = TRUE),
                  data = trend_abundance_data,
                  subset = Species == 'Styela clava')
summary(test.vglm)
```
Note the large standard errors on the intercepts.

#### Extracting coefficients
```{r}
coef(test.vglm)[3]
```

#### Extracting P values
```{r}
(t <- lrtest(test.vglm))
```
```{r}
t@Body
```

```{r}
t@Body$`Pr(>Chisq)`[2]

```

I  ran into problems calling  `lrtest()` from within the nested tibble, so we 
return to pulling significnace tests for the coefficients from the model 
summary.


```{r}
summary(test.vglm)@coef3
```

```{r}
summary(test.vglm)@coef3['Year', 'Pr(>|z|)']
```


#### Construct Nested Tibble
```{r}
nested_abundance <- abundance_data %>%
  filter(! is.na(Species)) %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  nest()
```

#### Add Model and Coefficients Estimate Information
```{r}
nested_abundance <- nested_abundance %>%
  mutate(year_vglm = map(data,
                        function(df) vglm(Abundance ~ Year, 
                                          family =cumulative(parallel = TRUE),
                                          data = df)))%>%
  mutate(vglm_coefs = map(year_vglm,
                        function(mod) coef(mod))) 
```

```{r}
nested_abundance <- nested_abundance %>%
  mutate(vglm_slope = map(vglm_coefs,
                          function(cs) cs[[length(cs)]]),
         vglm_p     = map(year_vglm,
                          function(mod) summary(mod)@coef3['Year', 'Pr(>|z|)']))
```


#### Examine Results
```{r}
for (s in nested_abundance$Species) {
  cat('\n\n')
  print(s)
  row <- nested_abundance[nested_abundance$Species == s,]
  print(paste('Slope:', row$vglm_slope, 'p:', row$vglm_p))
}
  
```

## Table of Results
```{r}
nested_abundance %>%
  mutate(Trend = if_else (vglm_p>0.05, 
                          'No Trend',
                          if_else(vglm_slope < 0,  # VGLM returns results for probability of being below thresholds
                                  'Increasing',
                                  'Decreasing'))) %>%
  select(Species, Trend) %>%
  arrange(Species) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Interestingly, those trends are identical in direction and significance to the 
trends determined earlier by the binomial model based only on presence/absence 
data.

We compare slopes.
```{r}
cbind(nested_presence$glm_slope, nested_abundance$vglm_slope)
  
```
The slopes are sometimes identical -- probably when there were only two 
categories of abundance recorded (effectively present and absent, regardless of\
the nominal abundance).  however, that is not always the case, so these two
analyses are based on slightly different information, but returning functionally
similar results.
