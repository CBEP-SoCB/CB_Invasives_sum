# Introduction
This Notebook provides data preparation for analyzing the MIMIC invasive species 
monitoring program from Casco Bay.

This notebook has not been carried forward into detailed analysis, as the State 
of Casco Bay indicator used only simple graphical summaries.

The Marine Invader Monitoring and Information Collaborative (MIMIC) in Casco Bay 
is a partnership between CBEP, the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve 
(Wells NERR), and the regional MIMIC program.  The Regional effort includes 
participants from several other New England States.

Wells NERR trains community scientists to identify (currently) 23 species of 
invasives, including tunicates, bryozoans, algae and crustaceans. Scientists 
visit sites monthly between May and October and document abundance of these 
non-native species. 

The program began with two sites in Casco Bay in 2008 and has expanded in 
ensuing years to sample an additional mainland site and 12 sites across four 
Islands (Peaks, Chebeague, Long, and Great Diamond).

# Add Order Factors
We need to organize graphics by island in consistent structure.
We will use a bar chart, organized by Island and a common sequence within island 
groups.  To facilitate that, we need a factor that orders sites consistently
within island groups.  While we are at it, we create alternate labels for 
the plots.

```{r}
orders <- tribble (
  ~Site,                            ~Order,      ~Label,
  "Spring Point Marina",               1,         "Spring Point Marina",  
  "SMCC Dock",                         2,         "SMCC Dock",
  "Siegel's Reef",                     3,         "Siegel's Reef",  
  
  "Peaks Dock",                        1,          "Peaks Dock",          
  "Peaks Tidepool",                    2,          "Peaks Tidepool", 
  
  "Great Diamond Island Dock",         1,          "Great Diamond Dock",    
  "Great Diamond Island Tidepool",     2,          "Great Diamond Tidepool",
  
  "Long Island Dock",                  1,          "Long Island Dock",  
  "Fowler's Tide Pool",                2,          "Fowler's Tidepool",   
  
  "Chandlers Wharf Dock",              1,          "Chandlers Wharf Dock",  
  "Chebeague Stone Pier",              2,          "Stone Pier",   
  "Waldo Point" ,                      3,          "Waldo Point")
```

```{r}
abundance_data <- abundance_data %>%
  left_join(orders, by = 'Site')

presence_data <- presence_data %>%
  left_join(orders, by = 'Site')
```

# Recent Data Only
```{r}
recent_presence_data <- presence_data %>% 
  filter(Year > 2015)
recent_abundance_data <-abundance_data %>% 
  filter(Year > 2015)
```

#  Analyzing Sampling Effort
Lets look at distribution of EFFORT by sites and years.
```{r}
site_visits <- presence_data %>%
  group_by(Site, Year, Month) %>%
  summarize(Sampled = n() > 0,
            .groups = 'drop')   # This includes NA values, which are still
                                # evidence of a site visit.

site_visits %>%
  group_by(Site, Year) %>%
  summarize(Visits = sum(Sampled)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = Visits) %>%
  select("Site", sort(colnames(.)))
```

So...

1. Only the South Portland sites (Siegel's Reef and SMCC Dock) have a long 
   enough record for robust trend analysis.  Peaks Dock and Chebeague Stone Pier 
   have six years of record.

2. Several Sites have almost never been sampled, and should probably be dropped 
   from any site by site analysis, but could be included in Bay-wide species 
   occurrences.

# Trend Data
For trend sites, we need sites with data from at least five of the last ten
years, and at least two years prior to the most recent five years.

```{r}
trend_sites <- site_visits %>%
  group_by (Site, Year) %>%
  summarize(Sampled = any(Sampled > 0, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  group_by(Site) %>%
  summarize(Years = sum(Sampled),
            Recent = sum(Sampled & Year > 2015),
            .groups = 'keep') %>%
  filter(Years >= 10, Recent >= 3) %>%
  pull(Site)
  
trend_presence_data <- presence_data %>%
  filter (Site %in% trend_sites)
trend_abundance_data <- abundance_data %>%
  filter (Site %in% trend_sites)
```

# Analysis Pricipals
We have to be a bit careful here about interpreting these data, because of 
varying annual effort. We need to make sure we are scaling analyses by effort.
We will consider a unit of effort to be the combination of a site and a month of 
sampling.

We also need to consider different patterns of "common".  
    *  Species found at high abundances  
    *  Species found in most years  
    *  Species found at most sites.   

Some species appear more abundant in recent years, but that may reflect 
different distributions of effort among years and sites.

This suggests a couple of binomial models. but binomial models are going to 
be structurally unstable, since many species are rare enough that we will have 
structural zeros, and thus a significant Hauke-Donner effect.
